# Security

Supported security fixes are released for the latest alpha and latest stable minor. Report vulnerabilities privately to `security@wetus.co`; do not open a public issue. Include the affected version, impact, and a minimal reproduction. We acknowledge reports within three business days.

The public app key is an identifier, not a secret. Never put server credentials in an application. This SDK does not access IDFA, GAID, pasteboard data, or probabilistic fingerprints. Install identity stays in Keychain and sensitive values are redacted from logs.
